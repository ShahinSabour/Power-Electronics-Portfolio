# Power Electronics Portfolio

---

- This is set of simulations on Matlab which I have simulated over the last years. According to the table, you can find inverters with different modulation in order to generate stepped output waveforms.
- This page comprises links to simulated invertes on matlab 2016a with available simulink model and displays my hands-on experience on working with this real-time simulator in Power Electronics.
